	<p> Harvey describes her experience of being an artist using a digital space in order to create her art. She talk about how at the time she graduated from college with her art degree, she couldn't afford a studio in which to make her art, therfore she started desgining websites and started to use websites a s a medium from her art. She describes her experience with digital sculpture as "sculpting math". She also talks about how some of the scuptures, despite being made digitally, are brought into the real world with physcial modes such as 3D printing in order to let her art exist in the present.</p>
