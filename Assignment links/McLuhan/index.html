    <h1>The Medium is the Message</h1>
    <p>Marshall McLuhan's famous phrase "The medium is the message" refers to the idea that the medium being used, for example tv, print, etc., influences the message that is being conveyed, more so than the actual content of the message itself. McLuhan argued that the characteristics of a medium, such as its speed, scale, and sensory impact, have a distinct impact on the way we perceive the world around us. He believed that we often fail to see the true impact of a medium because we are too focused on the content, and not on the medium itself. In essence, the medium becomes an extension of ourselves and shapes how we think and communicate.</p>
