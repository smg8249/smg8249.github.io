          <p>Jack FM seems to maintain a similar song selection process in current times, playing mainly rock and alternative hits of the past 40 years. Their website seems devoid of any information about their process, simply stating “Our JACK FM playlist mix is crafted song by song combining the mystical science of mood and emotion with decades of music diversity. You know the songs, but you don't know what's coming next!” The only acknowledgement is in their newsletter’s St.Patrick's day announcement, boasting about how they “Play what they want” and their lack of a DJ, proclaiming “Ratings don't suck.”
            There is no DJ in between songs, rather prerecorded snippets that are used on repeat. These snippets are presented by a smug male voice, who seems to bear the personality of a stereotypical cocky, asshole, LA celebrity personality.
