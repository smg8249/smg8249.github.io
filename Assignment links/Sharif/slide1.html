            <p>Sharif’s poem about their uncle talks not only about his time in the military, but about the life he left behind. Sharif emphasizes the humanity in her uncle and in turn that of other soldiers. Their descriptions of the photos of him during wartime detail different parts of his body, and what they may be doing. This motif is present throughout the entire piece, the author uses it to describe the settings in this poem. It’s a unique and beautiful way of describing a scene that highlights the people and their emotions without stating what they feel or much at all about the surrounding environment.</p>
