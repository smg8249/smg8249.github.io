            <p>Sharif’s use of army prose in a distinct font has the opposite effect of their descriptions of the pictures. The words used feel impersonal and lack empathy, a stark contrast from Sharif’s delicate narration of their uncle’s experiences. The fact that this style is only introduced later in the piece makes the army’s words even more impactful. The way it’s introduced is perceived as harsh and jarring.</p>
